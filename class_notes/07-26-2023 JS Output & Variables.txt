JavaScript vs Other programming languages
Interpret: JavaScript: more flexible, less rules
Compiled: Java, C#, TypeScript -> more rules and lots of exceptions and errors


Visual Studio Code: This is a Code Editor commonly used for JS
Intellij IDEA: This is mostly for Java and Kotlin

These code editors are known as IDE (Integrated Development Environment)


Compiler: checks if the source code has any syntax error
Execution: running code

VARIABLES - Declaration vs assignment vs initialization
let name; // declaration - reserve memory for the name
name = "John"; // assignment

let age = 25; // initialization


= assignment operator




____ data = "value";


const pi = 3.14;

const firstMonthOfTheYear = "JANUARY";


+ OPERATOR

Example: "hello" + "abc"    -> helloabc
         "123" + "12"        -> 12312

when used between numbers = addition
Example: 12 + 3     -> 15
         0 + 0.5    -> 0.5

When used between string and number = concatenation
Example: "John" + 45    -> John45

When used between number and string = concatenation
Example: 4 + "abc"      -> 4abc
