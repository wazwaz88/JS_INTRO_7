let num = 1.5; 
let num2 = 10; 

-It is accurate up to 15-16 precision
-BigInt data type is used for larger number

"2" * 5     => 10
"10" / "2"  => 5
"abc" * "Hello"     => NaN -> Not a Number


Number functions
toPrecision(2)  -> you want to see 2 digits regardless of decimal part
toFixed(2)      -> you want to see 2 digits for the decimal part


-9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991 -> any number between these is a safe integer and can be stored as a number
Anything less than -9007199254740991 or more than  9007199254740991 is not safe integer and can be stored as a bigint

isInteger() vs isSafeInteger()
